first of all, [here is the live link](https://poetic-fairy-53495c.netlify.app/) 

## Why? 🤔
The idea of creating this autocomplete app was to improve my js foundations and learn more about [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## What does it do? 🤓
It's a simple component that searchs for matches into an array
Then it shows you the suggestions that you can then select one of them or not

## Want to run it locally? 💻
There is no secret, clone the repository and open the index.html or use your favorite live server

### TODOS 📝
- improve folder structure
- improve code readability
- add acessibility
- add unit tests
